All sound files are from https://www.freesound.org/browse/tags/sound-effects/ unless clearly stated in the code next to them.
Some code (such as tree generation and wind physics) was inspired by outside code. THis has been commented in the code.

Processing version 2.2.1 is the only processing version this has been tested on. Versions 3.* do not support a core library needed to use the leap motion, so our program will not run on these versions.

HOW TO USE:
Right hand controls wind direction and severity
Left hand controls user point interation
Arrow keys can too be used to control wind, but this only for debugging.
"R" is to regrow trees

HOW TO RUN:
Open "SurrealGarden.pde" in processing 2.2.1 and press the play button.
